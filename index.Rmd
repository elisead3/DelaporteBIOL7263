### Educational Experience

Growing up, I was homeschooled by my mom until I reached college. I attended Parkland Community College originally and graduated from there with an Associate in Science with Honors in 2017. I then transferred to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Molecular and Cellular Biology with Academic Distinction in 2019. 

During my senior year of college, I was an undergrad chemistry TA, teaching primarily general chemistry labs. After graduating, I continued working as a chemistry TA for an additional three years. I then entered the Biological Sciences Ph.D program at the University of Tulsa in Fall 2022. 

### Research Background

I was originally a pre-med major, so I did not pursue any research experiences during undergrad. After I started teaching chemistry, I decided I would rather continue studying science instead of applying to medical schools. I then worked in a neuroscience lab at UIUC for a brief period in addition to my job as a chemistry TA. 

I am now a graduate student in Dr. Fakhr's lab at the University of Tulsa, where we study foodborne pathogens. I'm currently working on writing my first literature review, and I am shadowing Dr. Karki to learn lab techniques as he studies the aerotolerance of *Campylobacter* bacteria.
